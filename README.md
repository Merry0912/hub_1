# Hi, I'm Marjo Buenaobra

### :woman_technologist: About Me :
- I'm Sr. Systems Engineer and a Product Support Group Team Lead from my previous company.
- I've been practicing DevOps-related skills alongside my work as a Systems Engineer. focusing on tools like Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and Terraform. I’ve built small CI/CD pipelines, automated deployments in test environments, and explored cloud services like AWS/Azure.This hands-on practice confirmed that DevOps is the right direction for me. It leverages my background in systems while pushing me toward automation and modern infrastructure, areas I’m genuinely excited about.
- I became increasingly interested in automation, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure-as-code practices, which led me to start learning tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Terraform on my own.
